# Stock Data Visualization Script

This Python script utilizes the yfinance and matplotlib libraries to fetch stock data, calculate the percentage difference, and create a comprehensive visualization. The script generates a candlestick chart representing open, high, low, and close prices, a volume bar chart, and a percentage difference plot. The user is prompted to input a stock ticker, and the script fetches the last 60 days of stock data, excluding weekends and holidays. The resulting visualizations are saved as a PNG file for further analysis.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3
- Required Python libraries: yfinance, pandas, matplotlib, mplfinance

## Usage
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stock-data-visualization.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd stock-data-visualization`
3. Install the required libraries: `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run the script: `python3 stock_data_visualization.py`

Follow the on-screen instructions to input the stock ticker. The script will generate visualizations and save them as PNG files.
